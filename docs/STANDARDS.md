# The estate standard stack

Owner: crew (all sessions). Date: 2026-08-24. Ruling: R7 ("we need standardisation today")
and R9 ("the review includes getting it fully operational — add to acceptance criteria").

This page names ONE standard per layer. A component not on this page needs a one-line stated
deviation in its PR, and the review grades the deviation. Every choice below was researched
online with sources on the record in `science/RESEARCH-LEDGER.jsonl` (entries dated
2026-08-24); nothing here is a recollection.

## The stack, one line per layer

| Layer | Standard | Status today | Why this one (ledger receipt) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Substrate | Laptop + launchd until managed k8s | live | Founder ruling: laptop is the substrate until k8s; self-hosted k8s starts fail ~70% within 18 months, so the exit is MANAGED k8s |
| GitOps (at k8s time) | Flux | not yet | Recommended for solo-operator clusters; CNCF Graduated, Apache-2.0. Argo CD is the reviewed deviation (97% prod adoption, but a UI service to run) |
| Admission policy | Kyverno, CEL ValidatingPolicy API only | migrating | CNCF Graduated 2026-03-24; legacy ClusterPolicy is REMOVED at v1.20 (Oct 2026) — new policies on the legacy API grade REWORK on sight |
| Policy proof | `kustomize build \| kyverno apply/test`, grading the JSON REASON field | live in prospector | `kyverno test`'s summary has an open false-pass bug class (#11519); the REASON field is the truth |
| Data | DuckDB 1.4 LTS + dbt-core (Apache-2.0), DuckLake v1.0 when data outgrows one file | live | Licence survives resale; DuckLake is plain Parquet + a catalog file, portable by construction (LAW 19) |
| Data registry | `science/sources.json` — every store declared or declined with a reason | live, gated | Gate 25 reconciles the registry against the hourly crawl both ways |
| Job monitoring | Healthchecks (self-hosted, BSD-3) dead-man switch wrapping launchd jobs | to adopt | The only surveyed OSS that tells PASS from NOT RUN — the estate's biggest gap; reachability tools (Uptime Kuma, Gatus) cannot |
| Notifications | Apprise (BSD-2) | to adopt | Provider-agnostic send path (~100 services incl. Telegram); delivery proof stays on the caller (LAW 28) |
| Backups | restic, with a monthly restore drill | to adopt | Closest 1:1 for the custom backup scripts; `restic check` is the drill |
| Secrets | sops + age; in-cluster later: secrets-as-files, rotation-safe precedence (file wins) | live | Research found nothing that supplants sops+age; pydantic-settings' env-over-file precedence is the wrong direction for rotation |
| LLM providers | LiteLLM (MIT core) as the bridge layer | to adopt | Replaces the hand-rolled kimi/deepseek/direct bridges; flags on record: enterprise split, 4,889 open issues |
| Agent traces | OpenTelemetry GenAI semconv → Langfuse (MIT core, self-hosted) | partially live | The single largest lock-in escape available; Langfuse containers already run |
| Agent board / sync | GitHub Issues (crew repo) | live | No mature OSS agent board exists (researched); do not build one |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions; evidence gates; merge-when-green poller until required checks return with a deploy-key bypass | live | Native auto-merge cannot arm before checks pass; required checks block the hourly snapshot push until the bypass actor exists |
| Instructions | `AGENTS.md` per repo, vendor files are symlinks | live | R8: no estate asset in a vendor-named home |

## What stays custom, on purpose

Researched, no mature equivalent exists — these are NOT wheels: the claim gate (DONE must
link to passing evidence; no OSS product does this), the Telegram gateway (no maintained
coding harness has a connector), the local asset inventory (Steampipe is cloud-API-shaped),
and the law-to-guard enforcement map. Everything else hand-rolled is a migration candidate
and grades REWORK when its replacement above is live.

## Licence rule (LAW 40: build it so it could be sold)

Apache-2.0 / MIT / BSD: use freely. ELv2 / FSL / Collate CCL: internal use is fine; add a
diligence note. GPL server components: flag before adopting. A dependency with NO licence
file grants nothing and is unusable. Never call a project "CNCF Graduated" without checking
`landscape.yml` — Backstage is Incubating, k3s and Velero are Sandbox, Talos is not CNCF.

## Review acceptance criteria (every review, every lane)

1. Grade every file KEEP / REWORK / NOT-RAISING-THE-BAR (R3).
2. Primary axis is LAW 43 / R6: hand-rolled code doing a mature platform's job grades
   REWORK with the replacement named from this page.
3. **Operational proof (R9): the review is not finished until the work is proven running
   on the live system.** The REVIEW record carries an `Operational:` line quoting the
   command and output — the scheduled job green, the service serving, the gate deciding.
   Merged-but-not-running grades REWORK.
4. Defects get a demonstrated failing input, or they are labelled "process risk:".
5. Evidence is shown, not described: screenshot on the PR (LAW 22), `Options considered`
   in the body, receipts in the commit message.
