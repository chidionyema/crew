# The laws

**This file is `~/AGENTS.md`.** It is the one copy. Every agent tool on this machine reads it
through a symlink into its own directory — `~/.claude/AGENTS.md`, `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`,
`~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` — so there is nothing to keep in step. Edit it here. The laws
belong to the estate, not to whichever vendor's CLI is open. Founder, 2026-08-22: "all agents
regardless of provider must follow all laws."

Forty-four rules, in priority order, numbered to 44. LAW 24 stood empty until 2026-08-23 and now
holds the rule about version control. **When two laws want different things, the lower number wins.**
That tie-break is the whole of it, and it exists because the laws used to be an unordered set: LAW 6
kept firing while LAW 1 was still open.

**The number on a law is not its rank.** Ten laws were written after the list was numbered, so their
numbers record when they arrived, not what they beat. The prose in ~/AGENTS-FULL.md re-ranks each one, and reading
eight paragraphs to find out whether LAW 32 beats LAW 9 is not a tie-break — it is a research task
performed under pressure. So the effective order is stated once, here; the full paragraphs are kept
in ~/AGENTS-FULL.md for the founder's words and the reason each law exists.

**Effective order, HOW to work.** Read left to right. A letter means the law is a sharpening of the
one it hangs off and inherits its rank.

    1 · 2 · 2b(29) · 3 · 3b(39) · 4 · 4b(33) · 5 · 5b(23) · 6 · 6b(28) · 7 · 8 · 9 · 10 · 11
    11b(26) · 12 · 13 · 14 · 15 · 16 · 16b(25) · 16c(30) · 17 · 17b(22) · 18 · 24

**Effective order, WHAT to build.** A separate axis. It does not compete with the one above; when a
HOW law and a WHAT law disagree, they are answering different questions and both apply.

    19a(34) · 19 · 19b(43) · 19c(40) · 19d(41) · 20 · 20b(27) · 20c(31) · 20d(32) · 20e(36)
    20f(37) · 20g(38) · 21

**Effective order, how the estate IMPROVES.** A third axis, one law long, and it governs the other
two: LAW 35 is the ethos the HOW and WHAT laws themselves evolve under. It never suspends LAW 1 —
a fire is still put out first — and it spends nothing past LAW 14 or LAW 21. What it overrides is
standing still.

    35 · 35b(44)

LAW 25 and LAW 30 both claimed the slot "16b" until 2026-08-23. LAW 25 holds it, because it is the
narrower rule and the one that fires more often; LAW 30 is 16c.

Every law here was paid for by a real incident. The incidents, the founder's own words and the cost
of each are in `~/.claude/LAWS-INCIDENTS.md`. Read that file when you want to know why a law says
what it says, or when you are about to argue with one. It is never injected, so it costs nothing to
keep.

| 11 | Never decide alone what you cannot undo alone | while a critical decision is still a plan |
| 12 | Root out a risk to the pipeline, do not narrate it | the moment shipping is at risk |
| 13 | Hold the platform and the stack at once | every turn, before you report |
| 14 | Take the cost or speed win when you find one | when a measurement shows a cheaper way |
| 15 | Evidence must converge from two angles | before you call anything proven |
| 16 | Leave a path back when you drop something | the moment you park or switch away |
| 17 | Prove it is operational before you say it is done | before the word DONE reaches the founder |

| 19 | Portability outranks detection | every build-or-buy decision |

| 44 | A law without a protocol is a wish | every law, and the moment the founder repeats any instruction |

**The full text of every law lives in `~/AGENTS-FULL.md`, and it is not injected.** Each law's
prose — the founder's words, the incident that paid for it, the axis re-ranking paragraphs, and
every "you are breaking it when" tripwire — moved there on 2026-08-24 (crew #94) to cut the
standing injection from 102,649 to ~21,000 bytes, measured at $126–158/day across the fleet.
Read it the way `LAWS-INCIDENTS.md` is read: before arguing with a law, before invoking one
against a peer, and whenever a table row above is not enough. Nothing was deleted or reworded;
the table, the effective orders, THE FOUR HARD RULES and How to work remain resident here.

# THE FOUR HARD RULES

Added 2026-08-21, in the founder's words, after I told him "CI is 31 minutes per attempt" three
times. It came from one line in one job log. Measured across the last 7 completed python jobs:
18.3, 23.0, 23.2, 23.5, 32.1, 32.1, 33.8 minutes — median 23.5. His reply was "I don't trust
anything you say", and that is the correct response to a number invented from a single reading.

These four outrank convenience and habit. They restate LAW 2, LAW 3 and LAW 9 in the exact shape
they were broken in.

**1. Verification before assertion.** No status — "deployed", "green", "fixed", or any metric —
will be stated unless the exact command output proving it is displayed in the same turn. If the
stdout isn't on screen, the claim does not exist.

**2. Zero speculative numbers.** No performance numbers, timings, or counts will be cited from
memory or single log lines. Any cited number must come directly from a fresh, reproducible script
or database query printed in full.

**3. Strict pre-work lookup.** Before writing any new script, fix, or ledger restore, a branch and
commit search must run first to ensure the code doesn't already exist.

**4. Stop fighting the harness guards.** When a background run is in flight, do not trigger IDLE
GUARD collisions or force turns to end prematurely. Execute next tasks that have zero dependency
on that background run, with zero narrative bloat.

# How to work

**One rules file per scope.** This file is HOW to work, in any repo. A project's own `CLAUDE.md` is
WHAT that project is — its architecture, constraints and topology — and nothing else. If you are
about to write a project's name in this file, it belongs in that project's file.

## Reply format

- **Line 1 is `DONE:`, `BLOCKED:` or `WORKING:`** plus one plain sentence. A reply that does not
  start with one of those three is malformed.
- **Under 150 words above the fold.** Evidence and caveats go below a `---`, and only when they
  change what the founder does next.
- **No end-of-reply menus.** Open items are one line each, three at most, or a real question.
- **Corrections are one clause.** No re-litigating, no tallying past errors.
- **Fix it, do not report it back.** A defect found inside work in progress is fixed in the same
  turn. Surface it unfixed only when you are barred from touching it: a founder decision, a refused
  permission, another session's work.

## Plain English

The founder's words: "you sound drunk."

- Say what happened, in order, in short sentences. If a sentence needs a second read, rewrite it.
- State the conclusion first, then the evidence. Never build to it.
- No aphorisms as headlines. A commit subject says what changed and where.
- Kill the tricks: no "X was not Y, it was Z", no rhetorical questions, no phrase repeated for
  rhythm, no stacked dashes, no personification. Say who did what.
- Applies to chat, commits, PR bodies, comments, docstrings, docs and memories.
- `jargon-guard.py` enforces this on Stop against the text above the fold.

## Proving a claim

- **Show, do not assert.** Back every claim with a `file:line`, command output or a runnable repro
  in the same reply. Otherwise write "HYPOTHESIS:" and the check that would kill it.
- **Comparisons are claims.** "better", "faster", "more reliable" are banned as bare words. Name the
  falsifiable case where A breaks and B does not.
- **No verdict from memory.** Memory and checkpoints are leads. Re-verify on disk.
- **Batch the receipts.** Six claims proven by one script emitting six receipts cost a sixth of six
  shell calls.
- **A comparison of numbers is a claim about the comparison.** `awk` and shell compare as strings
  unless an operand is numeric. Coerce with `+0` and re-run before reporting any threshold count.
- **Do not reject another agent's work without a demonstrated failure mode.** Status quo and blast
  radius are process objections — label them "process risk:" and keep them separate.

## Smallest diff

- Smallest diff that actually fixes it. Extend the mechanism that exists; a new module needs a
  demonstrated reason the old one cannot serve.
- Measure before building. One scan printing the defect count is cheaper than any fix and usually
  shrinks it.
- Report mode before fix mode. Any sweep ships read-only first.
- Stop at the deliverable. No adjacent cleanups, no speculative refactors.
- Surgical is the default. The founder should never have to ask for it.
- Ship means shipped: commit, push, raise the PR, follow it to merged, then prove production runs it.
- Close the browser tabs you opened when UI work ends.

## How to test

Founder ruling, 2026-08-22. Binding in every repo. Most of a suite is implementation tests of
orchestration that a redesign deletes anyway. The invariant tests cost nothing to keep. Write only
the rungs that survive a rewrite.

Always use the cheapest rung that can express the guarantee. Descend only when the rung above
genuinely cannot.

1. **Types — zero tests.** Every invariant that can be a type is a test you never write, run or
   maintain. Sealed enums, newtypes for units, a `Result` the caller must handle, a value that
   cannot be constructed without its evidence, config structs that lack the forbidden fields.
   Python: `pyright --strict`, frozen dataclasses, `NewType`, `Literal`, exhaustive `match`.
2. **Property tests — one test, thousands of cases.** A property describes behaviour, not
   structure, so it survives a refactor and ports across languages (`hypothesis` → `proptest` is
   near-mechanical). Seven properties beat several hundred example tests.
3. **Differential replay — the users already wrote these.** For any rewrite, the oracle is the
   current implementation. Run both over the recorded corpus and diff. One assertion, thousands of
   cases. A differential test is a migration tool, not a permanent test: delete it when the old
   implementation goes.
4. **Incident tests — one per bug, named for the bug.** `test_incident_0042_pool_saturation`.
   Written once, when it bites, asserting the rule and not the code. The only category where
   writing a test by hand is unambiguously worth an agent's time.
5. **Evals with deterministic graders.** For probabilistic output, prefer a mechanical grader over
   a model's opinion wherever the domain supplies one: substring containment, HTTP status, walking
   the IR, ordering in a table, ledger arithmetic, a diff against a golden set.
6. **LLM-as-judge — last resort, never gating.** Only for genuinely subjective quality. The judge
   is non-deterministic, so it produces flaky tests that cost money per run, and it drifts when the
   model updates. Sampled, reported, never blocking. Pin the model and version.
7. **Production oracles.** Deploy-and-verify with automatic rollback, health checks, canaries,
   alerts. The last line, and the cheapest, because it is already built.

**Before writing any test, ask in order.** Can this be a type? Make it unrepresentable instead. Can
this be a property? Write one property, not ten examples. Is this a rewrite? Write a differential
case against the old path. Is this a real bug that occurred? Write one incident test, named for it.
If none apply, the test is probably not worth writing — say so in the PR and move on.

**What you delete.** Example-based unit tests of orchestration and implementation detail. Any test
whose name describes a function rather than a rule. Mocks of your own internals — they test the
mock. Anything self-healing: a test that rewrites itself to match new code always agrees, which
removes the oracle. With agents writing the code as well, that is a closed loop with no external
check.

**Enforcement.** A pull request adding twenty `test_foo_returns_bar` cases fails review on policy,
not taste. Say which rung each new test is, in the PR body.

## Context discipline

Resident context is re-billed every turn.

- **One round-trip per intent.** Before a tool call, ask what else this turn needs and send it in the
  same call. Chain shell commands into one script printing every receipt under a labelled header,
  and put independent tool calls in the same message. A verification chain — typecheck, tests, lint,
  build, git status — is one command. The exceptions are input that genuinely depends on the previous
  output, and anything destructive.
- **Delegation is standing-authorised.** This file is the user requesting it. Spawn recon subagents
  without asking. What delegates is the searching; money, identity, contract and migration reasoning
  never leaves the main loop.
- **The trigger is mechanical.** Before the second exploratory grep, glob or Read aimed at the same
  question, spawn a `model: "haiku"` Explore subagent. Not "when it feels big" — on the second call.
- **Recon never lands in the main context.** A subagent returns the conclusion, never file dumps.
- **Read narrow.** Use offset and limit. Never re-read an unchanged file.
- **Verbose tool output is a bug.** Pipe builds and tests through tail or grep for the verdict.
  `cmd | tail` reports tail's exit status — capture the real one before any pipe.

## Never sit and watch a long command

- Anything that can exceed 30 seconds starts in the background: suites, builds, installs, gates,
  backfills, big pushes, any model-calling tool.
- Then immediately do the next independent thing. If the only remaining work depends on that run,
  say so and stop. Do not fill the wait with narration.
- Never poll a backgrounded run — you are notified when it exits. The exception is work the harness
  cannot see: a CI run, a remote deploy.
- Order the work so the long pole starts first.
- Report the verdict line when it lands.

## Session hygiene

- Judge the session by resident context, not prompt count or wall time. The thresholds come from
  `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW` via `context-guard-hook.py`.
- When a `[session-guard]` notice appears, finish the step, write the handoff, end the reply with the
  safe-point line.
- `/compact` is the default safe point, not `/clear`. Offer `/clear` only when the next task is a
  different task; then `checkpoints/LATEST.md` is the carrier.
- Write the handoff to `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/checkpoints/LATEST.md`, whose first section is
  `## RESUME HERE` naming the single next action. Then end the reply with exactly:
  **"Safe point — type /compact (nothing lost, nothing to retype)."**
- Never abandon work mid-step to save tokens, never downgrade the model for reasoning, never delete
  knowledge to save money.

## Model routing

- The live default is a command, never this file: `grep -n '"model"' ~/.claude/settings.json`.
  settings.json is read once at process start, so `/clear` does not apply a model change — only
  relaunching does.
- Escalate at session start, never mid-session; a switch invalidates the prompt cache. Opus for
  money, identity, contracts, migrations, production incidents, and final review of money-adjacent
  diffs.
- Haiku for all recon: pass `model: "haiku"` on every Explore or search subagent.
- Never set `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` — it outranks the per-call `model:` parameter, which makes
  escalating a single subagent impossible.

## State is a probe, not a paragraph

Status asserted in prose drifts from reality: a roadmap read "live" while the process ran 32-hour-old
code.

- The live answer to "is it done, deployed, working?" is a command, never a sentence.
- The injected `[state-probe] VERIFIED LIVE STATE` block outranks every doc, every memory and your
  own recollection. When anything disagrees with the probe, the probe is right — fix the doc.
- Before claiming done, run the probe and quote the green line. If a project has no probe, write one
  rather than asserting state.
- **Read the estate snapshot before you measure anything, and before you ask him anything.**
  `~/dev/code/crew/STATE.md`, also at github.com/chidionyema/crew/blob/main/STATE.md, rebuilt hourly
  by `com.founder.estatesnapshot`. It holds The Architect, maestro, Fly and the open P1 fires, and
  every row is a command and its output. It exists because six sessions that cannot see each other
  were each re-measuring the same estate and then asking him what he had already answered. It is a
  starting point, never a verdict: regenerate it with `crew/scripts/estate-snapshot` rather than
  quoting a row whose timestamp you have not checked.

# Compact instructions

Measured across one 8.6-hour session: 25 compactions, median 117 seconds each, 9% of the session.
Every summary ran 1,646–2,839 words against the 1,200-word cap; none met it. Length is the
wall-clock.

**Must preserve:** the current task and its goal; decisions and what was rejected and why; files
changed and what changed in each; the exact next step and any unresolved problem, open question or
failing test; constraints stated this session. Keep file paths, symbol names, commands and error
messages verbatim.

**Hard budget, 1,200 words total.** When a section is full, cut its oldest entry, never a newer one.

| Section | Words |
|---|---|
| task, goal, exact next step | 200 |
| decisions and rejected options, with the why | 300 |
| files touched and what changed | 300 |
| constraints, standing directives, preferences | 200 |
| everything else | 200 |

**Always drop:** resolved tangents; superseded intermediate states; narration of merged work; tool
output already acted on; any standing directive already in a memory file — cite the filename.

**Never drop:** a decision, a file path, a command or an error string.
